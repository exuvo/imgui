/** Helper: Manually clip large list of items.
 *  If you are submitting lots of evenly spaced items and you have a random access to the list, you can perform coarse
 *  clipping based on visibility to save yourself from processing those items at all.
 *  The clipper calculates the range of visible items and advance the cursor to compensate for the non-visible items we
 *  have skipped.
 *  ImGui already clip items based on their bounds but it needs to measure text size to do so. Coarse clipping before
 *  submission makes this cost and your own data fetching/submission cost null.
 *  Usage:
 *      ImGuiListClipper clipper(1000);  // we have 1000 elements, evenly spaced.
 *      while (clipper.Step())
 *          for (int i = clipper.DisplayStart; i < clipper.DisplayEnd; i++)
 *              ImGui::Text("line number %d", i);
 *  - Step 0: the clipper let you process the first element, regardless of it being visible or not, so we can measure
 *      the element height (step skipped if we passed a known height as second arg to constructor).
 *  - Step 1: the clipper infer height from first element, calculate the actual range of elements to display, and
 *      position the cursor before the first element.
 *  - (Step 2: dummy step only required if an explicit items_height was passed to constructor or Begin() and user call
 *      Step(). Does nothing and switch to Step 3.)
 *  - Step 3: the clipper validate that we have reached the expected Y position (corresponding to element DisplayEnd),
 *      advance the cursor to the end of the list and then returns 'false' to end the loop. */
